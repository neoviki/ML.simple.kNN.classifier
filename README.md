## Simple k-nearest neighbour classifier implementation with sklearn

In this project, I am trying to explain KNN in a simplified manner.

#### Problem: 

	A person of age(x) and height(h) drink milk?

#### Expected Answer:
	
	Yes (or) No

#### Training Data: [ data/training_age_vs_like_milk.csv  ]
	
	The training data contains a list of person's age, height, and their corresponding liking towards milk. Here we take age and height as input and their preference towards milk as output.

#### Testing Data: [ data/test_age_vs_like_milk.csv ]

	The testing data contains a list of person's age, height, and their corresponding liking towards milk. Here we take age and height as input and their preference towards milk as output.
